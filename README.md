# Employee Management System using Binary Search Tree
This project is an Employee Management System implemented using a binary search tree data structure. The program allows you to perform various operations related to managing employee data. The system is implemented in MIPS assembly language.

## Features
The Employee Management System provides the following features:

Adding a new employee (A): Adds a new employee to the company's records.<br />
Printing the data of employees in preorder (P): Prints the data of employees in the binary search tree in preorder traversal.<br />
Printing the data of employees in inorder (I): Prints the data of employees in the binary search tree in inorder traversal.<br />
Printing the data of employees in postorder (O): Prints the data of employees in the binary search tree in postorder traversal.<br />
Checking if the company has employees or not (E): Checks whether the company has any employees.<br />
Closing the company and firing all employees (C): Closes the company and removes all employees from the records.<br />
Firing a person from the company (D): Removes a specific employee from the company's records.<br />
